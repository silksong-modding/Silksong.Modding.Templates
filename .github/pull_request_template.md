### Checklist

* No change is too small for a release, so pick one:
  * [ ] I have updated the package version following semantic versioning
  * [ ] There is another change actively WIP that will update the version (link issue or PR here)
  * [ ] This PR does not change the template content/config.
* If updating to support a new Silksong version only:
  * [ ] I have updated template.json to include the new game version.
  * [ ] I have installed the updated template locally and ensured that a plugin created for the new game version builds out of the box.
